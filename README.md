This repository is the official PyTorch implementation of our AAAI-2022 [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02446), in which we propose DiffSinger (for Singing-Voice-Synthesis) and DiffSpeech (for Text-to-Speech).

## Environments
```sh
conda create -n your_env_name python=3.8
source activate your_env_name 
pip install -r requirements_2080.txt   (GPU 2080Ti, CUDA 10.2)
or pip install -r requirements_3090.txt   (GPU 3090, CUDA 11.4)
```

## DiffSpeech (TTS version)
### 1. Preparation

#### Data Preparation
a) Download and extract the [LJ Speech dataset](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/), then create a link to the dataset folder: `ln -s /xxx/LJSpeech-1.1/ data/raw/`

b) Download and Unzip the [ground-truth duration](https://github.com/MoonInTheRiver/DiffSinger/releases/download/pretrain-model/mfa_outputs.tar) extracted by [MFA](https://github.com/MontrealCorpusTools/Montreal-Forced-Aligner/releases/download/v1.0.1/montreal-forced-aligner_linux.tar.gz):  `tar -xvf mfa_outputs.tar; mv mfa_outputs data/processed/ljspeech/`

c) Run the following scripts to pack the dataset for training/inference.

```sh
export PYTHONPATH=.
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python data_gen/tts/bin/binarize.py --config configs/tts/lj/fs2.yaml

# `data/binary/ljspeech` will be generated.
```

#### Vocoder Preparation
We provide the pre-trained model of [HifiGAN](https://github.com/MoonInTheRiver/DiffSinger/releases/download/pretrain-model/0414_hifi_lj_1.zip) vocoder.
Please unzip this file into `checkpoints` before training your acoustic model.

### 2. Training Example

First, you need a pre-trained FastSpeech2 checkpoint. You can use the [pre-trained model](https://github.com/MoonInTheRiver/DiffSinger/releases/download/pretrain-model/fs2_lj_1.zip), or train FastSpeech2 from scratch, run:
```sh
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python tasks/run.py --config configs/tts/lj/fs2.yaml --exp_name fs2_lj_1 --reset
```
Then, to train DiffSpeech, run:
```sh
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python tasks/run.py --config usr/configs/lj_ds_beta6.yaml --exp_name lj_ds_beta6_1213 --reset
```

Remember to adjust the "fs2_ckpt" parameter in `usr/configs/lj_ds_beta6.yaml` to fit your path.

### 3. Inference Example

```sh
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python tasks/run.py --config usr/configs/lj_ds_beta6.yaml --exp_name lj_ds_beta6_1213 --reset --infer
```

We also provide:
 - the pre-trained model of [DiffSpeech](https://github.com/MoonInTheRiver/DiffSinger/releases/download/pretrain-model/lj_ds_beta6_1213.zip);
 - the individual pre-trained model of [FastSpeech 2](https://github.com/MoonInTheRiver/DiffSinger/releases/download/pretrain-model/fs2_lj_1.zip) for the shallow diffusion mechanism in DiffSpeech;
 
Remember to put the pre-trained models in `checkpoints` directory.

## DiffSinger (SVS version)

### 0. Data Acquirement
- See in [apply_form](https://github.com/MoonInTheRiver/DiffSinger/blob/master/resources/apply_form.md).
- Dataset [preview](https://github.com/MoonInTheRiver/DiffSinger/releases/download/pretrain-model/popcs_preview.zip).

### 1. Preparation
#### Data Preparation
a) Download and extract PopCS, then create a link to the dataset folder: `ln -s /xxx/popcs/ data/processed/popcs`

b) Run the following scripts to pack the dataset for training/inference.
```sh
export PYTHONPATH=.
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python data_gen/tts/bin/binarize.py --config usr/configs/popcs_ds_beta6.yaml
# `data/binary/popcs-pmf0` will be generated.
```

#### Vocoder Preparation
We provide the pre-trained model of [HifiGAN-Singing](https://github.com/MoonInTheRiver/DiffSinger/releases/download/pretrain-model/0109_hifigan_bigpopcs_hop128.zip) which is specially designed for SVS with NSF mechanism.
Please unzip this file into `checkpoints` before training your acoustic model.

(Update: You can also move [a ckpt with more training steps](https://github.com/MoonInTheRiver/DiffSinger/releases/download/pretrain-model/model_ckpt_steps_1512000.ckpt) into this vocoder directory)

This singing vocoder is trained on ~70 hours singing data, which can be viewed as a universal vocoder. 

### 2. Training Example
First, you need a pre-trained FFT-Singer checkpoint. You can use the [pre-trained model](https://github.com/MoonInTheRiver/DiffSinger/releases/download/pretrain-model/popcs_fs2_pmf0_1230.zip), or train FFT-Singer from scratch, run:

```sh
# First, train fft-singer;
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python tasks/run.py --config usr/configs/popcs_fs2.yaml --exp_name popcs_fs2_pmf0_1230 --reset
# Then, infer fft-singer;
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python tasks/run.py --config usr/configs/popcs_fs2.yaml --exp_name popcs_fs2_pmf0_1230 --reset --infer 
```

Then, to train DiffSinger, run:
```sh
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python tasks/run.py --config usr/configs/popcs_ds_beta6_offline.yaml --exp_name popcs_ds_beta6_offline_pmf0_1230 --reset
```

Remember to adjust the "fs2_ckpt" parameter in `usr/configs/popcs_ds_beta6_offline.yaml` to fit your path.

### 3. Inference Example
```sh
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python tasks/run.py --config usr/configs/popcs_ds_beta6_offline.yaml --exp_name popcs_ds_beta6_offline_pmf0_1230 --reset --infer
```

We also provide:
 - the pre-trained model of [DiffSinger](https://github.com/MoonInTheRiver/DiffSinger/releases/download/pretrain-model/popcs_ds_beta6_offline_pmf0_1230.zip);
 - the pre-trained model of [FFT-Singer](https://github.com/MoonInTheRiver/DiffSinger/releases/download/pretrain-model/popcs_fs2_pmf0_1230.zip) for the shallow diffusion mechanism in DiffSinger;

Remember to put the pre-trained models in `checkpoints` directory.

*Note that:* 

- *the original PWG version vocoder in the paper we used has been put into commercial use, so we provide this HifiGAN version vocoder as a substitute.*
- *we assume the ground-truth F0 to be given as the pitch information following [1][2][3]. If you want to conduct experiments on MIDI data, you need an external F0 predictor (like [MIDI version of DiffSinger](usr/configs/midi/readme.md)) or a joint prediction with spectrograms.*
